# Sample dataset (replace this with your marketing data)
data = {
    'text': ['The product is excellent!', 'Very disappointed with the service.',
             'Amazing experience, highly recommend it.', 'Average quality, not worth the price.'],
    'sentiment': ['positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'negative']
}

# Creating a DataFrame from the dataset
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Text preprocessing: tokenization, removing stopwords, and lemmatization
stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()

def preprocess_text(text):
    words = word_tokenize(text.lower())  # Tokenization and converting to lowercase
    words = [lemmatizer.lemmatize(word) for word in words if word.isalpha()]  # Lemmatization
    words = [word for word in words if word not in stop_words]  # Removing stopwords

# Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets

# Training a Naive Bayes classifier
classifier = MultinomialNB()

# Evaluating the model

# Example usage: predicting sentiment for a new text

This code provides a basic sentiment analysis implementation using a Naive Bayes classifier. For more complex and accurate results, consider experimenting with different machine learning algorithms, feature extraction techniques, and text preprocessing methods. Additionally, you might want to explore more extensive datasets for training the model to enhance its performance on real-world marketing data.
